# Changelog

Dated entries, newest first. Written for a reader picking this up cold —
or a future session needing to know what already exists and why.

## 2026-09-16 — Service created and deployed

**Live:** `https://api-973103193216.europe-west4.run.app` → `api.rassimok.dev` (mapping created, DNS pending)

- Quarkus 3.39.3 service with `/status` and `/q/health`.
- **Java 25**, and this is a ceiling rather than a preference: Mandrel
  (the native compiler) tracks the JDK and stops at `jdk-25`. There is no
  Mandrel for 26 or 27, so native compilation rules them out. 25 is also
  the current LTS, so nothing is given up.
- **Native only.** JVM Dockerfiles deleted; `Dockerfile.native-micro` is
  the single build path. Measured: 23 ms startup, 40 MB RSS, 51 MB binary,
  5m51s to compile on 2 cores.
- Uptime captured via `@Observes StartupEvent`, *not* a static initialiser.
  GraalVM evaluates static init at build time, which would freeze the
  compile moment and silently report nonsense — a bug invisible to JVM tests.
- CI deploys via **Workload Identity Federation**; no service-account key
  is stored in GitHub. The OIDC provider is locked with
  `assertion.repository=='rassimok-dev/api.rassimok.dev'`.
- Guardrails: `--max-instances 3`, budget alert at 5 PLN (50/90/100%).
- **PostgreSQL 18** pinned in config but deliberately not wired — the
  service stores nothing, and an unreachable datasource fails startup.

### Decisions worth not relitigating

- **Region is europe-west4, not Warsaw.** europe-central2 is ~20 ms closer
  but **forbids Cloud Run domain mappings** (HTTP 501). europe-west3 is
  likewise excluded. europe-west1 and europe-west4 allow them; west4 is
  nearer. The latency is irrelevant behind Cloudflare.
- **Cloud Run over Render.** Render's free tier spins down after 15 min
  with 30–60 s cold starts on 0.1 CPU, and its free Postgres expires after
  30 days. Neither is acceptable for something linked from a CV.
